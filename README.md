# Load up on guns, bring your friends
# It's fun to lose and to pretend
# She's over-bored and self-assured
# Oh no, I know a dirty word

# Hello, hello, hello, how low
# Hello, hello, hello, how low
# Hello, hello, hello, how low
# Hello, hello, hello

# With the lights out, it's less dangerous
# Here we are now, entertain us
# I feel stupid and contagious
# Here we are now, entertain us
# A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
# Yeah, hey

# I'm worse at what I do best
# And for this gift I feel blessed
# Our little group has always been
# And always will until the end

# Moi je m'appelle Bernard Minet.
# Heureusement que pour bouffer,
# y a mes copains,
# les japonais.
# Biouman et Dorothée ! 
# Hello, hello, hello, how low
# Hello, hello, hello, how low
# Hello, hello, hello, how low
# Hello, hello, hello

# With the lights out, it's less dangerous
# Here we are now, entertain us
# I feel stupid and contagious
# Here we are now, entertain us
# A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
# Yeah, hey

# And I forget just why I taste
# Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile
# I found it hard, it's hard to find
# Oh well, whatever, never mind

# Hello, hello, hello, how low
# Hello, hello, hello, how low
# Hello, hello, hello, how low
# Hello, hello, hello

# With the lights out, it's less dangerous
# Here we are now, entertain us
# I feel stupid and contagious
# Here we are now, entertain us
# A mulatto, an albino, a mosquito, my libido
# A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
# A denial, a denial, a denial, a denial
